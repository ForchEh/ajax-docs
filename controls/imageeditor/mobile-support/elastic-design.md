# Elastic Design


This article explains the **elastic design capabilities RadImageEditor offers**. The [Lightweight RenderMode]({%slug imageeditor/mobile-support/render-modes%}) of RadImageEditor supports **elastic design as of Q3 2015** (**Figure 1**).

**RadImageEditor** does not create elastic design by itself, but can fit in a page that follows this pattern. This means that its **Lightweight RenderMode** supports **changing the font size** without breaking the control's appearance - if the new size is larger than the original, the elements in the control will simply increase their size as well to accommodate the text. This fluid layout is achieved by using `em` units for setting dimensions and paddings in the control, instead of `px`because `em` units are tied to the font size. This allows dimensions and sizes to scale with the font size.

>important As of Q3 2015 only the ImageEditor control itself is fully elastic (i.e., takes the font size of the page). The toolbar requires additional CSS rules and the dialogs do not support elastic design (i.e., there may be issues with their appearance). This will be improved in future releases.
