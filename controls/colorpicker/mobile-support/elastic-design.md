# Elastic Design


This article explains the **elastic design capabilities RadColorPicker offers**. The [Lightweight RenderMode]({%slug colorpicker/mobile-support/render-modes%}) of RadColorPicker supports **elastic design as of Q3 2015** (**Figure 1**).

**RadColorPicker** does not create elastic design by itself, but can fit in a page that follows this pattern. This means that its **Lightweight RenderMode** supports **changing the font size** without breaking the control's appearance - if the new size is larger than the original, the elements in the control will simply increase their size as well to accommodate the text. This fluid layout is achieved by using `em` units for setting dimensions and paddings in the control, instead of `px`because `em` units are tied to the font size. This allows dimensions and sizes to scale with the font size.

>caption **Example 2**: Changing the font-size of a RadColorPicker via page-level CSS rules. 

````CSS
body {
	font-size: 16px;
	font-family: "Segoe UI", Arial, Sans-serif;
}
````
````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadColorPicker RenderMode="Lightweight" runat="server" ID="RadColorPicker1"></telerik:RadColorPicker>
````

>tip You can apply the CSS rule to the Color Picker only, or to its container if you do not want to change the entire page.
