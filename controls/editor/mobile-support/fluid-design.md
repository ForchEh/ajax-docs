# Fluid Design

This article explains the **fluid design capabilities RadEditor offers**.	The example below shows how you can set its size in percent so it can resize with its parent element and refresh it when needed.

## Fluid Design with RadEditor

You can set the **Width** and **Height** properties of the **RadEditor** in **percent**. This lets it resize together with its parent element. The control has no way of knowing its parent size has changed, however,so the developer needs to invoke the `repaint()` [client-side method]({%slug editor/client-side-programming/radeditor-object%}) of the map so it can recalculate its elements (toolbar, modules etc.). You can find a small sample in **Example 1**.

````XML
<style type="text/css">
	html, body, form {
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
		height: 100%;
	}
</style>

<script type="text/javascript">
	function repaintEditor() {
		$find("<%= RadEditor1.ClientID %>").repaint();
	}

	var TO = false;

	$telerik.$(window).resize(function () {
		if (TO !== false)
			clearTimeout(TO);
		TO = setTimeout(repaintEditor, 200);
	});
</script>

<div style="width: 70%; height: 70%;">
	<telerik:RadEditor runat="server" ID="RadEditor1" Width="100%" Height="100%"></telerik:RadEditor>
</div>
