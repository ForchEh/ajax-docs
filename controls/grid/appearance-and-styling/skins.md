# Skins



This help article discusses using skins in **RadGrid**. You can see examples of the built-in skins, you can learn how to create custom skins, plus you'llsee major properties you'll use to customize skins as well as a list of required names for skin images you must use for custom skins.

By default, all controls in the Telerik UI for ASP.NET suite have a polished look and feel, which is consistent across the whole product line.

All resources (scripts, skins, etc.) are implemented as Embedded WebResources in ASP.NET 3.x\4.x for a very easy and convenient deployment. The only thing you need to do is drag **RadGrid** from your toolbox onto your web page (no external files will be required) and **RadGrid** will use its default skin.

Generally, you can change the existing grid skins by setting the **Skin** property to the name of the skin. See the sections below for more info.

## Built-in Skins

The image below shows a thumbnail view of the embedded skins provided by Telerik. They are embedded in the Telerik.Web.UI.dll assembly as web resources.To use a built-in skin, the user only needs to set the **Skin** property of the control. Built-in skins are also provided in "C:\Program Files\Telerik\RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX Qx 20xx\Skins".

Except setting the **Skin** property to one of the built-in skins you can use it in the following ways:

* If a skin is not explicitly defined, the **Default** skin from the embedded web resources will be used.

* You can use a predefined skin or your own skin. When following the second approach you need to set EnableEmbeddedSkins=false and define **Skin** and **ImagesPath** property values (see the next paragraph for more details).

## Creating Custom Skins for RadGrid

A developer can create custom skins to use in **RadGrid**. They are not embedded so the control cannot register them automatically.If you use a custom skin you need to set the **Skin** property, and the **EnableEmbeddedSkins** property of the control to **false**. If you do not do so, the following exception will be thrown saying that there is no embedded skin matching the**Skin** property:

* Telerik.Web.UI.RadGrid with ID='RadGrid1' was unable to find embedded skin with name **'MySkin'**. Please, make sure that you spelled the skin name correctly, or if you want to use a custom skin, set EnableEmbeddedSkins=false. *

**RadGrid with**

By default, **RadGrid** expects the icons for its various action buttons to be part of the CSS skin's styles. Usually, all icons are part of a single sprite image, although this is not a requirement. However, you can also use separate icons, which are not part of the skin's styles. In order to set the filtering/sorting/paging/expand/collapse images and the data editing images (edit/update/delete/add record/refresh), you can create your own images and set the path to them through the **ImagesPath** property of **RadGrid**. Note that the names of these images should match those for the predefined skins(**Table 2**) in order to be referenced properly from the folder pointed through the **ImagesPath** property. Below is a list of those images:
