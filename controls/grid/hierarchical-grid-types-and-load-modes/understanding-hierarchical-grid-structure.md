# Understanding hierarchical grid structure



There are two general steps to implement a hierarchical grid:

1. **Design the hierarchy** In this step, using the designer or code-behind you should specify the structure of the hierarchical tables. This is related to populating the collection of **DetailTables** of RadGrid **MasterTableView** and the corresponding columns. It is important that this step is completed before Telerik RadGrid is bound to any data. For example the grid can have a similar structure:
    - MasterTableView
        - DetailTable(0)
            - DetailTable(0, 0)
        
    Each detail table (including the **MasterTableView)** is control of type **GridTableView**. This means that each control is represented by HTML table (runtime) object. This table has **RenderColumns**, **Columns** and**AutoGeneratedColumns** collections (see [ Getting familiar with the server side API ]({%slug grid/server-side-programming/overview%})) properties for settings style, group and sort expressions, etc. 
    
    The whole structure of Telerik RadGrid and its detail tables is saved in the **ViewState**. Therefore if you build a grid programmatically, you can safely do this on **PageInit** or **Page_Load** (see [ Programmatic grid creation ]({%slug grid/defining-structure/creating-a-radgrid-programmatically%})). For illustration on defining the groups in code-behind check out [this article]({%slug grid/functionality/grouping/group-by-expressions/programmatic-definition%}).

1. During runtime (when data-binding) Telerik RadGrid builds special structure of items corresponding to the structure of the detail tables. For each item in the master table a new control (**GridTableView**) will be created and will be assigned as a child of the master item. This control will be a copy of the corresponding table - that should be **DetailTable(0)**. Hence, if you have 3 items in the **MasterTableView** in the second level of hierarchy the grid will look like this:
    - MasterTableView
    + Item(0)
        + DetailTable0(copy 0)
    + Item(1)
        + DetailTable0 (copy 1)
    + Item(2)
        + DetailTable0 (copy 2)

    Here **Item(0)** is a parent item for **DetailTable(0)**. You can obtain its instance using the **GridTableView.ParentItem** property. As there is a third level of hierarchy (note each of the items of the copies of DetailTable(0) will have a detail table) which is a copy of DetailTable(0, 0). 
    
    For example, let's say that the copy of DetailTable(0) with index 0 has 2 items:
    + DetailTable0 (copy 0)
    + Item(0)
        + DetailTable(0, 0) (copy 0)
    + Item(1)
        + DetailTable(0, 0) (copy 1)
    
    Each copy of the detail tables should be data-bound to populate its items. Telerik RadGrid delegates full control of how this can be done to the developer - you should filter or select just the records that correspond to each detail table. Telerik RadGrid only restricts *when* this will happen - either through [Declarative hierarchy relations](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/grid/examples/hierarchy/declarative-relations/defaultcs.aspx) or [DetailTableDataBind event](http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/grid/examples/data-binding/programmatic-hierarchy/defaultcs.aspx). 
    
    If you choose the second approach, Telerik RadGrid fires **DetailTableDataBind** for each **DetailTable** that is about to be data-bound. However, this depends on the **HierarchyLoadMode** property of the corresponding **GridTableView**: 
    * **HierarchyLoadMode** is **ServerBind** - the **DetailTableDataBind** event will be fired immediately after the corresponding parent item is bound. 
    * **HierarchyLoadMode** is **ServerOnDemand** - the detail table will be bound as soon as its parent item is expanded. 
    
    Inside the **DetailTableDataBind** event handler you can determine which detail table is about to be data-bound by using its **DataMember** property. This property should have unique value assigned in step 1.
