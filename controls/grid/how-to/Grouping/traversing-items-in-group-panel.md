# Traversing Items in Group Panel



## 

You can iterate through the items placed in the group panel of a grid and modify their settings. This can be done quite easily using the **PreRender** event of the grid. The items in the group panel can be accessed using the **RadGrid.GroupPanel.GroupPanelItems** collection.

The following example illustrates how this is done. It changes the **ImageUrl** for the sorting image button of each group panel item and set its **CausesValidation** property to **false** (to avoid validation on click):



````C#	
protected void RadGrid1_PreRender(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    foreach (TableCell cell in RadGrid1.GroupPanel.GroupPanelItems)
    {
        foreach (Control ctrl in cell.Controls)
        {
            if (ctrl is ImageButton)
            {
                ImageButton button = ctrl as ImageButton;
                button.ImageUrl = "<my_img_url>";
                button.CausesValidation = false;
            }
        }
    }
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub RadGrid1_PreRender(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    Dim cell As TableCell
    For Each cell In RadGrid1.GroupPanel.GroupPanelItems
        Dim ctrl As Control
        For Each ctrl In cell.Controls
            If (TypeOf ctrl Is ImageButton) Then
                Dim button As ImageButton = CType(ctrl, ImageButton)
                button.ImageUrl = "<my_img_url>"
                button.CausesValidation = False
            End If
        Next ctrl
    Next cell
End Sub
