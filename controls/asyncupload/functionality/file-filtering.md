# File Filtering

## RadAsyncUpload File Filtering

As of Q1 2011, **RadAsyncUpload** supports file filtering. A file filter is an object with two properties: **Description** and **Extensions**. The **Extensions** property accepts a comma separated list of extensions upon whichthe select file dialog should be filtered. The **Description** property, as its name suggests, describes the extensions set.

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadAsyncUpload runat="server" ID="RadAsyncUpload1">
	<FileFilters>
		<telerik:FileFilter Description="Images(jpeg;jpg;gif)" Extensions="jpeg,jpg,gif" />
	</FileFilters>
</telerik:RadAsyncUpload>	
````

This setup will produce the following result:

**Silverlight:** <br> ![Silverlight module](images/asyncupload_filefiltering_silverlight.bmp) 

**Flash:** <br> ![Flash module](images/asyncupload_filefiltering_flash.bmp)

Note that when **RadAsyncUpload** is utilizing its IFrame module (when neither Flash nor Silverlight is installed) no filtering capabilities are available. This is because browsers donâ€™t provide native file filtering support.

You can apply as many filters as you want. Then, the user can choose among different filters via the Files of type combo box.
