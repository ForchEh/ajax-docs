# Client-Side Programming Overview



**RadAsyncUpload** provides a flexible client-side API.You can easily interact with the **RadAsyncUpload** object in the browser using the browser's client-side object. In addition to a varietyof [client-side events]({%slug asyncupload/client-side-programming/events%}),the client-side object model lets you achieve tasks while avoiding the postbacks thatwould trigger file uploading.

## Getting the Client-Side Object

**RadAsyncUpload** creates client-side objects withthe **ClientID** of the server-side object. You can obtain areference using the **$find()** method, as shown in the following JavaScript code:

````JavaScript
var upload = $find("<%= RadAsyncUpload1.ClientID %>");
````

## Calling Client-Side Methods

Once you have access to a client-side object, you can use it to call its client-side methods, as shown in the following examples.

## Using RadAsyncUpload with jQuery Intellisense

You can use [jQuery Intellisense]({%slug introduction/radcontrols-for-asp.net-ajax-fundamentals/using-jquery/jquery-intellisense%}) to get the client object of **RadAsyncUpload** as shown in this sample code:

````JavaScript	
function pageLoad() {
    var asyncUpload = $telerik.toAsyncUpload("RadAsyncUpload1");	
}	
````

## RadAsyncUpload

The following example uses only a single **RadAsyncUpload** control and demonstrates how by using client-side object the you can add an additional upload row tovisually demonstrate that the control can upload several files:

````JavaScript
function deleteUnusedFileInputs() {
    var upload = $find("<%= RadUpload1.ClientID %>"); upload.addFileInput();
}	
````
