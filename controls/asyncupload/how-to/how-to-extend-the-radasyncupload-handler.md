# How to Extend the RadAsyncUpload handler

## RadAsyncUpload custom handler

RadAsyncUpload's file handler can be inherited and extended to support custom functionality, for example, saving images directly to a database, without using temporary folder.

>caution The custom handler class should inherit from the **AsyncUploadHandler** one.
>

One can override the Process method which has the following signature:

````C#
protected override IAsyncUploadResult Process(UploadedFile file, HttpContext context, IAsyncUploadConfiguration configuration, string tempFileName)			
````
````VB.NET
Protected Overrides Function Process(ByVal file As UploadedFile, ByVal context As HttpContext, ByVal configuration As IAsyncUploadConfiguration, ByVal tempFileName As String) As IAsyncUploadResult
End Function	
````

UploadedFile is the file that is currently processed.

* HttpContext is the current HttpContext, since the handler implements the IRequiresSessionState interface the Session object is available as well.

* Configuration This is class that implements the IAsyncUploadConfiguration interface and by default has the following properties:

1. TargetFolder

1. TempTargetFolder

1. MaxFileSize

1. TimeToLive

* TempFileName is the uploaded file's temporary name.

As you may have noticed, the return type of the method is of type interface - IAsyncUploadResult. The reason for this is that if one want to return custom information they can create class that implements IAsyncUploadResult, populate it with the **CreateUploadResult\<T\>** method, set any custom added properties and then return it. The returned class is serialized and sent to the server. This means that one will be able to access it in the FileUploaded server-side event. Example:

````C#
protected void RadAsyncUpload1_FileUploaded(object sender, FileUploadedEventArgs e)
{   
	SampleAsyncUploadResult result = e.UploadResult as SampleAsyncUploadResult;
} 			
````
````VB.NET
Protected Sub RadAsyncUpload1_FileUploaded(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As FileUploadedEventArgs)
    Dim result As SampleAsyncUploadResult = TryCast(e.UploadResult, SampleAsyncUploadResult)
End Sub	
````

The other way around is also possible, to sent information from the page to the handler. The approach is pretty much the same, object that implements the IAsyncUploadConfiguration should be set to the RadAsyncUpload's UploadConfiguration property. The config object can be obtained using the **CreateDefaultUploadConfiguration\<T\>** method that is provided by RadAsyncUpload. The object passed to this generic method should implement the IAsyncUploadConfiguration interface. After that, the object is serialized and sent to the handler with each request. Example:

````C#
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) 
{
    // Populate the default (base) upload configuration into an object of type SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration      
    SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration config = RadAsyncUpload1.CreateDefaultUploadConfiguration<SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration>(); 
    // Populate any additional fields      
    config.UserID = 1;
    // The upload configuration will be available in the handler      
    RadAsyncUpload1.UploadConfiguration = config;
}			
````
````VB.NET
Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    'Populate the default (base) upload configuration into an object of type 
    SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration Dim config As SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration = RadAsyncUpload1.CreateDefaultUploadConfiguration(Of SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration)()
    'Populate any additional fields 
    config.UserID = 1
    'The upload configuration will be available in the handler 
    RadAsyncUpload1.UploadConfiguration = config
End Sub
````

Then, in the handler, the sent information can be obtained in the following way:

````C#
protected override IAsyncUploadResult Process(UploadedFile file, HttpContext context, IAsyncUploadConfiguration configuration, string tempFileName) 
{         
    int userID = -1;
    // You can obtain any custom information passed from the page via casting the configuration parameter to your custom class    
    var sampleConfiguration = configuration as SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration;    
    
    if (sampleConfiguration != null)    
    {       
        userID = sampleConfiguration.UserID;    
    }          
    // More code here.. 
}  		
````
````VB.NET	
Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Populate the default (base) upload configuration into an object of type SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration
    Dim config As SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration = RadAsyncUpload1.CreateDefaultUploadConfiguration(Of SampleAsyncUploadConfiguration)()

    ' Populate any additional fields
    config.UserID = 1

    ' The upload configuration will be available in the handler
    RadAsyncUpload1.UploadConfiguration = config
End Sub	
````
