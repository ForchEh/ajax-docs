# Skins



To make customizing the appearance of **RadDropDownList** as easy as possible, the control uses **skins.** A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that can be applied to RadDropDown elements (items, images, etc.) and defines their look and feel.

**RadDropDownList** is installed with a number of built-in skins:![dropdownlist skins](images/dropdownlist-skins.png)
