# Skins



**RadPanelBar** uses **skins** to control the overall look-and-feel of the panel bar. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that can be applied to the panel bar elements (items, images, etc.) and defines their look and feel. To apply a skin to the panel bar, set its **Skin** property, either using the properties pane or the **RadPanelBar** [Smart Tag]({%slug panelbar/design-time/smart-tag%}).

**RadPanelBar** is installed with a number of preset skins:![PanelBar Skins](images/panelbar-skins.png)

## Using No Skin

To use the panel bar with no skin, set the **Skin** property to an empty string and set the **EnableEmbeddedSkins** property to **False**. When using no skin, you will probably want to use your own [CSS classes]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/setting--the-css-class-of-items%}) to adjust the appearance of the panel bar.

## Customizing Skins

You can tweak the existing skins, or create your own. Each skin has two main elements: images and a stylesheet. When creating your own, it is a good idea to start with the stylesheet for an existing skin and alter that. See [Tutorial: Creating a Custom Skin]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/creating-a-custom-skin%}) for a step-by-step walk through. To use your own skin

1. Add the new CSS file to your project.

1. Drag and drop the CSS file from the Project Explorer onto your Web page.

1. Set the **EnableEmbeddedSkins** property of the **RadPanelBar** to **False**.

The stylesheet for a **RadPanelBar** skin has the name **PanelBar.[SkinName].css** and can be found in the **...Skins/[SkinName]** directory. The images are found in the **...Skins/[SkinName]/PanelBar** directory. For example, the stylesheet for the "Black" skin is called PanelBar.Black.css and is located in the ...Skins/Black directory. The images are found in the ...Skins/Black/PanelBar directory. The images are referenced by name from within the stylesheet.
