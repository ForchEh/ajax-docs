# Optimizing RadDatePicker Performance

Performance problems can be caused by using the picker in list controls. An example how to optimize this can be found here:

[Maximum performance with minimum output using Telerik RadDatePicker client-side API](http://www.telerik.com/blogs/maximum-performance-with-minimum-output-using-telerik-raddatepicker-client-side-api)

Also having many date pickers or time pickers on a page can render a lot of HTML and impact performance negatively. You can handle such scenarios by using a shared RadCalendar or RadTimeView. You can find more information and examples on the matter in [Using shared RadCalendar]({%slug datepicker/functionality/using-shared-radcalendar%}).
