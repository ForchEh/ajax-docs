## Skins

To make customizing the appearance of RadSearchBox as easy as possible, the control uses skins. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that can be applied to the searchBox elements and defines their look and feel. To apply a skin to the searchBox, set its Skin property, either using the properties pane or the RadSearchBox Smart Tag.
