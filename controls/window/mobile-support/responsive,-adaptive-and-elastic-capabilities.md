# Responsive, Adaptive and Elastic Capabilities

This article explains the **responsive design capabilities RadWindow offers**.	The [Lightweight RenderMode]({%slug window/mobile-support/render-modes%}) of RadWindow supports	**elastic design since Q2 2014**.

## Elastic Design with RadWindow

**RadWindow** does not create elastic design by itself, but can fit in a page that follows this pattern. This means that RadWindow does not support dimensions set in percent,but its **Lightweight RenderMode** supports **changing the font size** without breaking the control's appearance - if the new size is larger than the original,the elements in the control will simply increase their size as well to accommodate the text.This fluid layout is achieved by using `em` units for setting dimensions and paddings in the control, instead of `px`because `em` units are tied to the font size. This allows dimensions and sizes to scale with the font size.

Elements that use images or images sprites, however, cannot be increased in size, so the commands will keep having their original dimensions and position(aligned to the top of the titlebar).

**Example 2:** The following sample shows how to increase the font size of a RadWindow and the effect can be seen in comparison in Figure 1.

````ASP.NET
<style type="text/css">
	div.RadWindow
	{
		font-size: 18px;
	}
</style>
<telerik:RadWindow ID="RadWindow1" runat="server" Title="Longer Window Title" VisibleOnPageLoad="true" RenderMode="Lightweight" Width="450">
</telerik:RadWindow>
````
