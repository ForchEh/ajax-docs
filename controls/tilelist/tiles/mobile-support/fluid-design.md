# Fluid Design


This article explains the **fluid design capabilities RadTiles offer**. The example below shows how you can set its size in percent so it can resize with its parent element.

You can set the **Width** and **Height** properties of the Tile in percent. This lets it resize together with its parent element. You can find a small sample in **Example 1** that shows a simple `div` element that resizes with the browser and the tile inside resizes with it.
