# Skins

To make customizing the appearance of the **RadSpellChecker** dialog as easy as possible, the dialog uses **skins**. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that are applied to the HTML elements which make up the dialog, defining the look and feel.

To apply a skin, set the **Skin** property of the **RadSpellChecker** control.	You can set the **Skin** property using the properties pane or the control's [Smart Tag]({%slug spell/design-time%}).

**RadSpellChecker** is installed with a number of predefined skins:![radspell-skins](images/spell-skins.png)
