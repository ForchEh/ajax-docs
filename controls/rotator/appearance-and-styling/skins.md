# Skins

Skins control the overall look and feel of a **RadRotator** object. By using Skins consistently, you can make your rotators fit in with the design of the rest of a Web site, increasing usability and attractiveness.

Specify the skin to use by setting the **Skin** property of the **RadRotator** object. You can override this default skin by setting the **Skin** property on an individual **RadRotator** object.

**RadRotator** is installed with a number of preset skins:![RadRotator Skins](images/rotator-skins.png)
