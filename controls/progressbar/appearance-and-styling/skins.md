# Skins

**RadProgressBar** uses **skins** to control its overall look-and-feel. A skin is a set of images and a CSS stylesheet that can be applied to the control elements (items, images, etc.) and defines their appearance.

To apply a skin to a **RadProgressBar** control, set its **Skin** property.

**RadProgressBar** is installed with a number of preset skins. These are shown below:
