# Tabs Overview

The tabs inside **RadTabStrip** have a few important properties, which are listed below:

* **Text** is the text that appears on the tab.

* **ToolTip** is the text of a tooltip that appears when the user hovers the mouse over the tab.

* **Value** is a string value that you can associate with the tab for use when programming the tab strip behavior.

* **IsSeparator** specifies whether the tab acts as a separator.

* **IsBreak** specifies whether the tab strip displays the next tab in the collection in another row.

* **Enabled** controls whether the tab is initially enabled or disabled.

* **Selected** controls whether the tab is initially selected.

* **SelectedIndex** specifies which child item of the tab is initially selected.

* **NavigateUrl** and **Target** cause the tab to automatically launch another Web page (specified by **NavigateUrl**) in the window specified by **Target**. If the **Target** property is not set, the new Web page uses the current browser window.

* **PostBack** specifies whether the tab causes a postback when the user selects it.

* **ScrollChildren**, **PerTabScrolling**, **ScrollButtonsPosition**, and **ScrollPosition** specify how the tab [scrolls its child items]({%slug tabstrip/tabs/scrolling-tabs%}) when there is not enough room to display them all.

* **CssClass**, **SelectedCssClass**, **DisabledCssClass**, **HoveredCssClass**, and **ChildGroupCssClass** [control the appearance of the tab]({%slug tabstrip/appearance-and-styling/setting-the-css-class-of-tabs%}) when it is in its normal state, selected, disabled, under the mouse, and the appearance of its group of child items, respectively.

* **ImageUrl**, **SelectedImageUrl**, **DisabledImageUrl**, and **HoveredImageUrl** let you [specify an image]({%slug tabstrip/appearance-and-styling/adding-images-to-tabs%}) that appears on the left of the tab text when it is in its normal state, selected, disabled, and when the mouse hovers over it, respectively.

In addition to the built-in properties, you can add your own [custom attributes]({%slug tabstrip/tabs/custom-attributes%}) to tabs to expand their functionality.
