#intro

@{control1} can be a Primary Action Button (**Figure 1**).

The primary action button on the form has bright and saturated colors to pop up more and catch attention easily. You should use a primary action button to make the default/preferred/main/safe operation on the form stand out. At this point the rest of the buttons with their default appearance become Secondary Action buttons and do not draw as much attention.
