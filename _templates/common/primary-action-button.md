@[template](/_templates/common/primary-action-button.md#intro-base "control: @{value1}") This feature is built-in as of **Q1 2016**.
#end

#intro-main
The primary action button on the form has bright and saturated colors to pop up more and catch attention easily. You should use a primary action button to make the default/preferred/main/safe operation on the form stand out. At this point the rest of the buttons with their default appearance become Secondary Action buttons and do not draw as much attention.

#configuration

To switch to a primary action button, set the `Primary` property of the **@{control}** control to `true` (**Example 1**). The property defaults to `false` to result in the regular (secondary) button appearance for most cases.
